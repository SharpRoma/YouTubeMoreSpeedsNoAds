# YouTube More Speeds No Ads
The Shorts player is original, ads are not blocked in it. Now there are speed buttons under the player, from 1x to 4x, with a step of 0.25x. To the right of them there is a button for the 18+ mode. It is necessary for playing content with restrictions. In 18+ mode, the script detects ads, sets 16x speed and turns off the sound. The script also clicks the skip ad button when it becomes active. Changes in speed and sound do not affect video playback after advertising.

Install as a userscript [here](https://greasyfork.org/ru/scripts/538599-youtube-more-speeds-no-ads).\
You will need a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/).
